## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Document Question Answering Application** is designed for users to interact with PDF documents through questions based on document content. Users upload a PDF file, ask questions, and the backend processes the questions using NLP to deliver accurate responses. Document metadata is also stored, facilitating efficient tracking and retrieval.

### Key Features:
- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF documents to the platform.
- **NLP-Driven Q&A**: Users can pose questions, and the backend processes them using NLP.
- **Real-Time Response**: Questions are answered quickly, leveraging document data.
- **Metadata Storage**: Metadata for each document is stored for easier management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For building the interactive user interface

### Backend:
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building RESTful APIs
- **LangChain**: A framework for NLP processing and generating answers based on document content
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores metadata about uploaded documents
- **Local Filesystem**: Used for storing PDF files
